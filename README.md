Welcome to my professional portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills, I prioritized a minimalistic approach that focuses on clean presentation and functionality.

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Bootstrap 5** - Used for responsive layout and pre-built components
- **Emmet** - Accelerated workflow with abbreviations
- **Custom CSS** - For personalized styling and animations

### Development Approach
Throughout development, I utilized Bootstrap's border utilities to visualize grid layouts and ensure proper element placement. This helped me validate the structure before finalizing each section.

## Key Sections & Implementation

### Home Section
- Social media buttons with custom colors
- Interactive profile picture with hover animation

### Skills Section
- Outline-style buttons with hover effects
- Organized grid layout using Bootstrap's system

### Experience Section

- Structured content with unordered lists

## Future Improvements
